# Contract Details
## Greeter.sol
The contract is defined with the name "Greeter" and specifies that it complies with the MIT license.
The contract contains a private string variable called "greeting," which will store the greeting message added by users. The "private" visibility modifier restricts direct access to this variable from outside the contract.
The setGreeter function allows users to add a new message to the "greeter" string. It takes a string parameter _name and appends it to the end of the array.
The deposit function is a function to deposit tokens to our contract.
